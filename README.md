ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Eigenscribe! 

This is my space for portfolio projects, research exploration, and code playgrounds at the intersection of physical science, math, and AI. 

- ðŸ§ª **Interests:** statistical mechanics, quantum computing, bifurcation and phase-plane analysis, geometric algebra, and scientific software.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** build straightforward, educational, and technically/computationaly sound projects that bridge my academic background in biophysics with fundamental concepts in linear algebra. Alongside building a collection of projects I can be proud of, I aim to nurture my academic journey since graduating.
- ðŸ“‚ **Repositories:** a mix of ongoing work, prototypes, and polished porfolio pieces.

Thanks for stopping by! I really appreciate your time and interest. Feel free to explore my repos, open issues, or connect through the links in my profile.
